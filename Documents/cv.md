# Will Taylor

I'm a software engineer who loves building systems to solve problems. I have experience working on web services, web frontends, developer tools, and internal infrastructure projects, both greenfield and legacy.

Based in the UK, very strongly prefer remote positions.

## Professional Experience and Qualifications

_**Software Engineer at STFC** August 2020 to present_
  - Led redevelopment of an important but poorly maintained set of infrastructure applications:
    - Fixed critical bugs, security issues and performance problems.
    - Automated builds and deployments.
    - Created an e2e test suite.
    - Built auxiliary tools to assist operations and development work.
    - Set priorities for myself and a junior developer on the project, as well as onboarding them onto the project and providing support throughout.
    - Coordinated with related teams to improve integrations and processes.
  - Substantially improved performance of Java EE and ASP.NET web services/apps.
  - Standout projects:
    - Implemented a web app for browsing/editing experimental metadata. Provided a faster, clearer and more featureful interface than an existing (abandoned) application.
    - A suite of end-to-end tests for a distributed data pipeline. Improved development velocity and stability.
    - A metadata extractor for nexus files. Enabled the possibility of a much simpler deployment pipeline.
    - A template compiler for a subset of Apache Freemarker in .NET. Improved development velocity and correctness.

_**Graduate Software Engineer at STFC** August 2018 to August 2020_
 - Worked collaboratively in a group maintaining a mix of Java EE and .NET web services with ASP.NET frontends.
   - Contributed bug fixes, new features and performance improvements.
   - Worked closely with teammates in planning and reviews.
 - Rotated through other teams, in which I contributed to a PyQt GUI application for image reconstruction and investigated software quality tools for the CERN ATLAS trigger software.
 - Highlights:
   - Gathered requirements for, designed and implemented the core of a new web service.
   - Mentored a work experience student through a project analyzing operational data.

_**2:1 MEng Computer Science at Durham University** 2014 to 2018_
